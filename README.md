# Problems from Calculus by Spivak
This repo is an ongoing effort to complete all problems from the book Calculus by Michael Spivak.

There are inevitably errors - sometimes because of a silly typo in my solution, and sometimes because of an incorrect proof. There are over 800 problems in all. If you find an error, please create a pull request citing the relevant problem and why you think the solution is incorrect.
